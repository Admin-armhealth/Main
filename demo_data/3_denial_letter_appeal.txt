RE: AUTH REQUEST #999999
SERVICE: CPT 29881 (Knee Arthroscopy)

STATUS: DENIED

REASON FOR DENIAL:
We have reviewed your request for Right Knee Arthroscopy.
Based on Clinical Policy Bulletin 0001 (Meniscal Surgery), coverage is provided only when there is documentation of:
1. Significant mechanical symptoms (locking/catching).
2. Failure of at least 6 weeks of provider-supervised physical therapy.
3. MRI confirmation of tear.

Your request is denied because the submitted documentation did not verify requirement #2. The notes state "Patient tried PT" but did not provide specific start/end dates or discharge summary to confirm the 6-week duration requirement was met.

Therefore, the service is considered Not Medically Necessary.

APPEAL RIGHTS:
You have the right to appeal this decision within 180 days...
